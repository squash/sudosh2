.SH NAME
sudosh.conf \- configuration file for sudosh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sudosh.conf
is used to configure sudosh.  The log directory, logging parameters and other default entries are stored within this file.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP logdir
.RS
logdir = /path/to/logging/directory
Use this to set the default logging directory.  Both sudosh and sudosh-replay will use this to deteremine the logging directory.
.RE
.IP "default shell"
.RS
default shell = /path/to/default/shell
This is the default shell sudosh will use if it cannot automatically determine which shell to use..RE
.RE
.IP "immutable_recordings"
.RS
immutable_recordings = (enabled|disabled)
If enabled sets the append only flag on new recordings and changes the recording to
immutable once it is complete. Only available on Linux, default disabled.
.RE
.IP delimiter
.RS
delimiter = -
This is the character you want to delimit the logging files with.  For example some environments may use ths underscore "_" or dash "-" in the login names.  If this is the case use the delimiter option to change the logging delimiter to another character such as a period "." or comma ","  The delimiter must be 1 character in length and cannot be alphanumeric.
.RE
.IP syslog.priority
.RS
syslog.priority = PRIORITY
Use this option to set which syslog priority sudosh will use.  The default is LOG_INFO
.RE
.IP syslog.facility
.RS
syslog.facility = FACILITY
Use this option to set which syslog facility sudosh will use.  The default is LOG_LOCAL2
.RE
.IP "-c arg allow"
.RS
-c arg allow = command
This option can be used multiple times.  If you wish to use sudosh as a default login shell and want to allow users to copy files, you can allow them to use commands such as rsync and scp.  For each command you want to allow, use a new line and option. To allow all commands, use the special value of *.
.RE
.IP clearenvironment
.RS
clearenvironment = false
Set this option to true to clear shell environment variables for incoming sessions. Set to false for things like ssh agent forwarding.
