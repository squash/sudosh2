	* Added support for HP-UX.

2004-10-01 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
	* Deleted sudosh.  Perl wasn't an appropiate programming lanaguage
	  for this project.
	* Ported sudosh to C.

2004-10-02 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
	* Successfully compiled sudosh to work with pty devices.

2004-10-03 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
	* Successfully compiled sudosh to work with syslog.

2004-10-06 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
	* Added support for logging only keystrokes to syslog.
	* Added function for logging both input and output, which is
	  identical to the UNIX command script(5), to the file
	  ~/.sudosh_history

2004-10-12 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
	* Corrected keystroke bug in sudosh.c.
	* Corrected BS and DEL characters so that syslog is understandable
	  when user issues BS or DEL keys. ^H^H^H was too ugly.
	* Added support for AIX (removed MALLOC and REALLOC in configure.in)
	* Added support for ~/.sudosh_input for the keystrokes.
	* Added "DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS LLL" format for ~/.sudosh_input

2004-10-18 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
	* Gave up on keystroke logging to syslog.  It's impossible to
	  to trace the terminal to see if it's echoing keystrokes or not.
	  Bottom line is that passwords can be written to syslog, so I
	  removed this feature.  I had it secure under Linux, but AIX and
	  Solaris were different in the nature that the terminal returned
	  a ECHO when the ENTER key was pressed.
	* Ditched the syslog for now.  Everything is localized.
	* Added logdir automation to configure.in as well as host-type
	  recognition.
	* Added replay utility to playback sudosh sessions as they were
	  originally recorded.

2004-10-20 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
	* Removed syslog.c.

	  found and configured.

2004-10-25 Douglas Richard Hanks, Jr. <dhanks@gmail.com>
